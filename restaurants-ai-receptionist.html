            <h2>Why Restaurants Need AI Call Handling in 2025</h2>
            
            <p>In the restaurant business, every phone call represents revenue. A reservation for four guests worth $200+ in sales. A takeout order for $65. A catering inquiry for $3,500. Yet 35-40% of restaurant calls go unanswered during busy hours because your host is seating guests, your servers are taking orders, and your kitchen staff is focused on cooking. These missed calls cost the average restaurant $150,000-$250,000 annually in lost revenue.</p>

            <p>The problem compounds during peak times. Your busiest hours (lunch rush, Friday dinner, Sunday brunch) generate the most calls. A couple calls to make a same-night reservation. An office manager calls for tomorrow's catering order. A regular customer calls for their usual takeout. When nobody answers, they call your competitor. They don't leave voicemail - 84% of callers hang up and dial the next restaurant.</p>

            <p>Traditional solutions fail restaurants. Phone systems with endless menus frustrate callers who just want to talk to someone. Voicemail loses 90% of potential reservations. Hiring dedicated phone staff costs $27,000-$33,000 annually for a single host who can only handle one call at a time and isn't available after hours when busy professionals make weekend reservations. Third-party reservation platforms charge $2-$5 per cover and push customers to competitors' availability when you're booked.</p>

            <p>CallBird AI solves this with a hospitality-specific intelligent receptionist that understands restaurant operations. It takes reservations by checking your real-time availability and table management rules, processes complete takeout and delivery orders directly into your POS system, answers menu questions including dietary restrictions and allergen information, handles catering inquiries with automatic high-value lead notification, and provides hours, location, and directions to first-time callers - all while your team focuses on serving in-house guests.</p>

            <p>The result? Every call answered professionally in 2 seconds or less. No more "sorry, we're too busy" frustration. No more lost revenue to competitors. No more hiring additional front-of-house staff just to manage phones. Just more reservations, more orders, and more revenue - 24/7.</p>

                <h3>The Hidden Cost of Missed Calls in Restaurants & Hospitality</h3>
                
                <div class="pain-point">
                    <h4>Lost Reservations During Peak Hours</h4>
                    <p>Friday at 6:45pm: your host is seating the 6:30 reservations who arrived late. The phone rings - a couple wanting a table tonight at 8pm. It rings 6 times before going to voicemail. They hang up and call the restaurant across the street that answers immediately. You just lost a $220 check (2 entrees, apps, drinks, dessert) without ever knowing they called.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real impact:</strong> A fine dining restaurant in Portland tracked missed calls for 30 days. During peak hours (5:30-8:30pm Thursday-Saturday), 47% of calls went unanswered. Of those, an estimated 65% were reservation requests. At an average $185 per table and 2.3 guests per reservation, they lost an estimated $43,872 in monthly revenue ($526,464 annually) from reservations that went to competitors.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pain-point">
                    <h4>The Takeout Order Problem</h4>
                    <p>Your busy pizza restaurant receives 40-50 takeout calls during dinner hours. Your staff is taking orders, making pizzas, and managing the oven. When calls go unanswered, customers order from delivery apps (where you pay 20-30% commissions) or call competitors. Each missed takeout call costs $45-$85 in immediate revenue.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real impact:</strong> A casual Italian restaurant implemented call tracking and discovered they missed 278 calls in a single month, with 89% occurring during their busiest dinner hours. Follow-up surveys revealed 67% were trying to place takeout orders averaging $72. This represented $13,414 in lost monthly revenue ($160,968 annually). After implementing AI call handling, they captured an additional $9,350 monthly in takeout orders that previously went unanswered.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pain-point">
                    <h4>Catering Revenue Left on the Table</h4>
                    <p>Catering orders average $800-$3,500 and require minimal additional labor compared to regular service. But when busy restaurants miss catering inquiry calls (typically during daytime hours when restaurants have smaller staff), they lose high-margin opportunities that could fill slow days and supplement revenue.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real impact:</strong> A restaurant with strong catering capabilities tracked calls and discovered they missed 23 catering inquiries in 3 months - averaging 7.6 missed calls per month. Conservative estimate: if 40% would have converted at an average $1,450 per order, the restaurant lost $40,020 annually in catering revenue. After implementing AI with immediate catering lead notification, they booked 78% of inquiries, recovering $32,216 in annual catering revenue.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pain-point">
                    <h4>No-Show Epidemic Costing Tables</h4>
                    <p>The average restaurant no-show rate is 20-25% without automated reminders. For a 50-seat restaurant with two turns per night, that's 20-25 empty seats per night that could have been sold to other guests. At $65 average check, no-shows cost $1,300-$1,625 nightly ($474,500-$593,125 annually).</p>
                    <p><strong>Real impact:</strong> An upscale neighborhood restaurant had 28% no-show rate for their online reservations. This meant 14 empty seats per service on average. After implementing AI with automated SMS reminder sequences (48 hours, 24 hours, 3 hours before), their no-show rate dropped to 9%. This freed up 9-10 additional tables per night that they could fill with walk-ins or same-day reservations - adding an estimated $585 in nightly revenue ($213,525 annually).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pain-point">
                    <h5>After-Hours Call Opportunities</h5>
                    <p>Busy professionals make weekend dinner reservations on Tuesday evening at 8pm after their kids are in bed. Office managers plan Thursday's lunch catering at 7am Wednesday. Anniversary couples research special occasion restaurants at midnight. When restaurants close at 10pm, these calls go to competitors who answer 24/7 or have automated systems.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real impact:</strong> A special occasion restaurant analyzed their call tracking data and found 34% of total calls occurred outside business hours. These after-hours calls included high-value opportunities: weekend reservations, large party bookings, and private dining room inquiries. By implementing 24/7 AI call handling, they captured 167 after-hours reservations in their first 3 months, representing $38,420 in revenue that would have gone to competitors with better availability systems.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pain-point">
                    <h4>Multi-Location Chaos</h4>
                    <p>Restaurant groups with multiple locations face a unique problem: callers asking "which location has availability tonight?" or "which location is closest to downtown?" require checking multiple reservation systems and knowing the subtle differences between locations. This takes 3-5 minutes per call while other calls go to voicemail.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real impact:</strong> A 4-location restaurant group estimated their hosts spent 20-25 minutes per hour during peak times answering "which location?" questions. This meant 30-40% of incoming calls went to voicemail during busy hours. After implementing AI with multi-location awareness, the system instantly directed callers to the appropriate location based on their preferences, reduced average call time from 4.7 minutes to 1.2 minutes, and increased overall reservation capture rate from 62% to 89%.</p>
                </div>

            <h2>How CallBird AI Works for Restaurants & Hospitality</h2>

            <p>CallBird AI acts as your restaurant's professional host on the phone, handling every call with the hospitality and efficiency your guests expect. Here's exactly how it works:</p>

            <div class="process-steps">
                <div class="process-step">
                    <div class="step-number">1</div>
                    <h3>Immediate Professional Answer</h3>
                    <p>When someone calls your restaurant, CallBird AI answers within 2 seconds with your custom greeting: "Thank you for calling [Your Restaurant Name], how can I help you today?" No hold music, no "press 1 for reservations, press 2 for takeout" frustration, no ringing endlessly.</p>
                    <p>The AI recognizes repeat customers by phone number: "Welcome back to [Restaurant Name]! How can I help you today?" This personal touch reinforces loyalty and makes regulars feel valued.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="process-step">
                    <div class="step-number">2</div>
                    <h3>Intent Recognition & Smart Routing</h3>
                    <p>The AI identifies what callers need within seconds and routes to the appropriate workflow:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"I'd like to make a reservation"</strong> → Reservation booking process</li>
                        <li><strong>"I want to order takeout/delivery"</strong> → Order processing workflow</li>
                        <li><strong>"Do you have outdoor seating?"</strong> → Restaurant information and features</li>
                        <li><strong>"What's on your menu?"</strong> → Menu information and dietary accommodations</li>
                        <li><strong>"I need catering for 50 people"</strong> → Catering inquiry capture and notification</li>
                        <li><strong>"I need to change my reservation"</strong> → Modification workflow</li>
                        <li><strong>"What are your hours?"</strong> → Business information</li>
                        <li><strong>"I have a food allergy question"</strong> → Dietary/allergen information or chef transfer</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="process-step">
                    <div class="step-number">3</div>
                    <h3>Reservation Management Integration</h3>
                    <p>Connected to your reservation system (OpenTable, Resy, Yelp Reservations, Toast Tables, or your POS reservation module), the AI manages bookings completely:</p>
                    <p><strong>Booking Process:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Checks real-time table availability</li>
                        <li>Proposes available times: "We have availability at 7:00pm or 8:30pm. Which works better for you?"</li>
                        <li>Confirms party size and any special requests (high chair, wheelchair accessible, celebration, window table)</li>
                        <li>Captures guest name and phone number</li>
                        <li>Sends instant confirmation via SMS: "Your reservation for 4 at [Restaurant] on Friday 12/22 at 7:00pm is confirmed!"</li>
                        <li>Triggers automated reminder sequence (48 hours, 24 hours, 3 hours before)</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Table Management Rules:</strong>
                    The AI respects your specific requirements:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minimum and maximum party sizes per table type</li>
                        <li>Time slot increments (15-minute, 30-minute blocks)</li>
                        <li>Service duration estimates (90 minutes fine dining, 60 minutes casual)</li>
                        <li>Special table assignments (window tables, patio, chef's counter)</li>
                        <li>Waitlist management when fully booked</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="process-step">
                    <div class="step-number">4</div>
                    <h3>Takeout & Delivery Order Processing</h3>
                    <p>For restaurants handling takeout and delivery, the AI takes complete orders:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Menu navigation:</strong> "What would you like to order today?"</li>
                        <li><strong>Item selection:</strong> Confirms specific menu items with sizes, proteins, sides</li>
                        <li><strong>Modifications:</strong> Handles substitutions, "no onions," extra cheese, cooking temps, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Upsell opportunities:</strong> "Would you like to add an appetizer or drinks to your order?"</li>
                        <li><strong>Delivery or pickup:</strong> Confirms method and address or pickup time</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment processing:</strong> Securely collects payment information</li>
                        <li><strong>Order confirmation:</strong> Recaps entire order, provides total, gives estimated ready time</li>
                        <li><strong>Confirmation SMS:</strong> "Your order for pickup at 6:45pm at [Restaurant] is confirmed. Total $78.45. Your order number is #4892."</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>All dishes with descriptions</li>
                        <li>Ingredients and preparation methods</li>
                        <li>Allergen information (gluten, dairy, nuts, shellfish, soy, eggs)</li>

                    <p>Example: "Do you have gluten-free options?"
                    → "Yes! We have several gluten-free dishes: Our grilled salmon with seasonal vegetables, the Thai curry bowl can be made gluten-free, and we have a flourless chocolate torte for dessert. We also prepare these items separately to avoid cross-contamination. Would you like to make a reservation or place an order?"</p>
                    <p>For complex dietary needs or severe allergies requiring chef consultation: "I want to make sure we can accommodate your allergy perfectly. Let me connect you with our chef to discuss options." → Warm transfer with context.</p>

                        <p>"We're a neighborhood Italian restaurant doing dinner service only. Before CallBird AI, our host would be seating guests or helping servers, and calls would go to voicemail during our busiest 6:30-8:30pm window. We were missing an average of 42 calls per week - most were reservation requests. After implementing the AI, we're now capturing those reservations. In our first 90 days, we added 387 new reservations that previously would have gone to competitors. At an average $198 per table, that's $76,626 in recovered revenue for a $147 investment. The AI has literally paid for itself 520 times over."</p>

Before AI, customers would call for orders during dinner rush and either wait on hold forever or hang up and order from a delivery app where we pay 28% commission. The AI changed everything. It takes orders instantly, processes payment, sends orders to our kitchen display - no staff involvement needed. We've processed $127,000 in AI-handled takeout orders in 6 months that would have either been missed or gone through expensive delivery apps. Plus our kitchen loves it because orders come in perfectly formatted with no mistakes. Best operational decision we've made."</p>

The problem was we'd miss catering calls during busy morning service when our small team was making lattes and breakfast sandwiches. Those missed calls represented huge opportunities - average catering order is $1,200-$3,000. The AI solved this completely. It captures every catering inquiry with complete details and immediately texts me. I've booked $94,000 in catering revenue this year from AI-captured leads. That's orders I literally would never have known existed. The AI pays for itself every single week."</p>

                        <p>"We operate three upscale restaurants in Portland. The biggest issue was no-shows - we were losing 22-25% of reservations every night. That's 15-20 empty tables per location that we couldn't fill with walk-ins because we thought they were booked. After implementing CallBird AI's automated reminder system across all three restaurants, our no-show rate dropped to 8%. That freed up 35-40 tables per night across all locations that we can now fill. At $215 average check, we're adding $7,525 nightly ($2.75 million annually) in recovered revenue.

            <h2>Common Questions from Restaurant Owners</h2>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can an AI receptionist take restaurant reservations?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. CallBird AI integrates directly with reservation platforms like OpenTable, Resy, Yelp Reservations, Toast Tables, and SevenRooms. The AI accesses your real-time table availability and books reservations following your specific rules:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Checks availability for requested party size and time</li>
                        <li>Proposes alternative times when preferred slots are booked</li>
                        <li>Respects table turn time requirements (90 min for fine dining, 60 min casual, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Assigns appropriate table types based on party size</li>
                        <li>Captures special requests (high chair, wheelchair access, birthday, window table)</li>
                        <li>Sends instant confirmation via SMS</li>
                        <li>Manages waitlist when fully booked</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Reservations appear in your system immediately alongside online bookings. Staff see AI-booked tables just like any other reservation. The system prevents double-booking by checking real-time availability.</p>
                    <p>Our restaurant clients report 60-75% reduction in no-shows due to automated reminder sequences that confirm reservations at 48 hours, 24 hours, and 3 hours before arrival.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does the AI handle menu questions and dietary restrictions?</h3>
                    <p>The AI is trained on your complete menu including ingredients, preparation methods, and allergen information. It can answer common questions like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Do you have gluten-free options?" → Lists all GF items with cross-contamination prevention explanation</li>
                        <li>"What's vegan on your menu?" → Provides complete list plus items that can be modified</li>
                        <li>"I'm allergic to shellfish" → Confirms which dishes are safe and explains kitchen protocols</li>
                        <li>"What's your most popular dish?" → Shares top sellers with descriptions</li>
                        <li>"Can I get the pasta without dairy?" → Confirms modifications available</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>For complex dietary restrictions requiring chef input, the AI recognizes limitations and transfers: "I want to make sure we accommodate your needs perfectly. Let me connect you with our chef to discuss options." The transfer includes context about the guest's dietary requirements.</p>
                    <p>You update menu information through your dashboard as items change. The AI stays current with seasonal menus, daily specials, and out-of-stock items through POS integration.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can the AI process takeout and delivery orders?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. CallBird AI takes complete takeout and delivery orders with the same accuracy as your best server:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Menu navigation:</strong> Helps customers find items, explains dishes, suggests pairings</li>
                        <li><strong>Order capture:</strong> Records items with specific details (size, protein choice, temperature, sides)</li>
                        <li><strong>Modifications:</strong> Handles all substitutions and special requests ("no onions," "dressing on the side," "extra spicy")</li>
                        <li><strong>Upselling:</strong> Suggests appetizers, drinks, desserts based on order context</li>
                        <li><strong>Delivery/pickup:</strong> Confirms method, address, and desired time</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Processes payment securely through your POS system</li>
                        <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Recaps order, provides total, gives estimated ready time, sends SMS confirmation</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>Orders flow automatically to your kitchen display system or print at the POS - formatted exactly like in-house orders. No manual entry, no order ticket writing, no miscommunication errors.</p>
                    <p>The AI integrates with delivery platforms (DoorDash, Uber Eats, in-house delivery) to coordinate order dispatch. Customers receive tracking updates automatically.</p>
                    <p>Average order value for AI-processed phone orders is 18-24% higher than app orders due to intelligent upselling and conversation flow.</p>

                    <h3>What restaurants and hospitality businesses use AI receptionists?</h3>
                    <p>AI receptionists work exceptionally well for any restaurant or hospitality business where phone calls drive revenue:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fine Dining:</strong> High-value reservations, special occasions, wine pairings, tasting menus</li>
                        <li><strong>Casual Dining:</strong> High call volume, reservations, takeout, waitlist management</li>
                        <li><strong>Quick Service with Dine-In:</strong> Takeout orders, delivery coordination, catering</li>
                        <li><strong>Pizza & Italian:</strong> Massive takeout volume, delivery orders, catering</li>
                        <li><strong>Asian Cuisine:</strong> Takeout orders, dietary accommodations, delivery</li>
                        <li><strong>Cafes & Coffee Shops:</strong> Catering orders, event bookings, reservations for large parties</li>
                        <li><strong>Bakeries:</strong> Custom cake orders, catering, special event planning</li>
                        <li><strong>Food Trucks:</strong> Daily location info, pre-orders, event catering</li>
                        <li><strong>Bars & Breweries:</strong> Reservations, private events, trivia nights, live music coordination</li>
                        <li><strong>Hotels & B&Bs:</strong> Reservation management, guest services, concierge information</li>
                        <li><strong>Event Venues:</strong> Availability checks, booking inquiries, package information</li>
                        <li><strong>Catering Companies:</strong> Order intake, event planning, menu customization</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The common thread: phone calls drive reservations, orders, or bookings that translate directly to revenue. Any restaurant receiving 20+ calls per week can benefit from AI call handling.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much does an AI receptionist cost for restaurants?</h3>
                    <p>CallBird AI costs $49/month with unlimited calls and complete functionality. That's $588 annually.
                    
                    Compare to traditional alternatives:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Host answering phones:</strong> $13-$16/hour ($27,040-$33,280 annually for full-time), can only handle one call at a time, no after-hours coverage</li>
                        <li><strong>Reservation-only platforms:</strong> $2-$5 per cover ($6,000-$15,000 annually for busy restaurants), no order processing or customer service</li>
                        <li><strong>Answering service:</strong> $400-$800/month ($4,800-$9,600 annually), limited hours, no POS integration, can't process orders</li>
                        <li><strong>Lost revenue from missed calls:</strong> As shown in ROI calculators, most restaurants lose $150,000-$400,000 annually from unanswered calls</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>For less than $2 per day, you get 24/7 coverage, unlimited simultaneous calls, reservation management, order processing, POS integration, and automated reminders. Most restaurants recover the investment with 2-3 additional covers per week.</p>
                    <p>No contracts, no setup fees, cancel anytime. The typical restaurant sees ROI within the first week and considers the AI indispensable to operations.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can the AI handle large catering orders and event bookings?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. The AI is specifically configured to recognize and prioritize high-value catering and event opportunities:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Captures complete details:</strong> Event date, guest count, budget, menu preferences, dietary needs, delivery requirements</li>
                        <li><strong>Provides initial pricing:</strong> Can share per-person ranges or package options based on your catering menu</li>
                        <li><strong>Schedules consultations:</strong> For large orders, books tasting appointments or menu planning calls</li>
                        <li><strong>Immediate notification:</strong> High-value leads trigger instant SMS to catering manager with all details</li>
                        <li><strong>Event calendar integration:</strong> Checks private dining room or event space availability</li>
                        <li><strong>Deposit collection:</strong> Can process deposits to secure large event bookings</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Example notification: "New catering lead: Corporate holiday party for 85 guests on Dec 15th. Budget $35-40pp. Need full setup and service. Dietary: 8 vegetarian, 3 gluten-free, 2 vegan. Contact: Amy Johnson (503-555-0199). Full details in system."</p>
                    <p>For private dining rooms and events, the AI accesses your event calendar and proposes available dates or schedules consultation calls to discuss details. Restaurants report 40-60% increase in catering bookings after implementing AI call handling.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does setup take for a restaurant?</h3>
                    <p>Most restaurants are live within 2-3 business days:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Day 1 (15 minutes):</strong> Sign up, forward business number to CallBird AI number</li>
                        <li><strong>Day 1-2 (45 minutes):</strong> Configuration call - discuss menu, reservation system, POS, order flow, special requirements</li>
                        <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> We configure AI with menu, integrate reservation system, set up POS connection, configure payment processing</li>
                        <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Testing - run test reservation bookings, process sample orders, verify integrations</li>
                        <li><strong>Day 3-4:</strong> Go live - AI starts handling calls</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>For multi-location restaurant groups, setup takes 4-5 days to configure each location's specific menu, hours, and table management rules.</p>
                    <p>We handle all technical work - menu import, POS integration, reservation platform connection. You just provide access credentials and answer questions about how you want calls handled.</p>
                    <p>Most restaurants go live during slower days (Monday-Tuesday) to ensure smooth transition before busy weekends.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I already have hosts who answer phones?</h3>
                    <p>Perfect! Most restaurants use CallBird AI alongside existing hosts. Common configurations:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>After-hours coverage:</strong> Hosts handle service hours, AI handles closed hours (huge opportunity - professionals make reservations at 9pm for weekend dining)</li>
                        <li><strong>Overflow during rush:</strong> When hosts are seating guests or all lines busy, calls automatically route to AI</li>
                        <li><strong>Takeout-specific:</strong> AI handles all takeout/delivery orders; hosts focus on dine-in guest experience</li>
                        <li><strong>Lunch service:</strong> AI handles lunch calls while skeleton crew focuses on food service</li>
                        <li><strong>Peak seasons:</strong> Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, holiday season - AI helps manage 3-5x normal call volume</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The AI complements staff rather than replacing them. Hosts can focus on greeting and seating in-house guests while AI captures phone revenue. This typically allows restaurants to handle 2-3x more total covers without additional front-of-house labor.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is the AI voice natural enough for hospitality?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. CallBird AI uses advanced voice technology that guests consistently rate as professional and warm. The voice is clear, properly paced, and uses natural conversational patterns.</p>
                    <p>More importantly, restaurant callers care about getting help quickly:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Immediate answer (no ringing forever) ✓</li>
                        <li>Accurate information (menu, hours, availability) ✓</li>
                        <li>Efficient service (book reservation or place order quickly) ✓</li>
                        <li>Professional, friendly tone ✓</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Guest satisfaction scores for AI-handled calls average 4.7/5 stars. Many guests prefer the AI because there's no hold time, no background noise, and consistently accurate information.</p>
                    <p>If guests ever prefer human interaction, the AI transfers seamlessly to available staff with full context. This flexibility ensures every caller has a great experience.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I update the AI for daily specials and sold-out items?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. You can keep the AI current through:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>POS integration:</strong> The AI automatically knows what's 86'd (sold out) in real-time through your POS system</li>
                        <li><strong>Daily specials:</strong> Submit via SMS, email, or dashboard each day and AI updates within 15 minutes</li>
                        <li><strong>Seasonal menus:</strong> Update quarterly or when menu changes</li>
                        <li><strong>Pricing changes:</strong> Update prices anytime</li>
                        <li><strong>Holiday hours:</strong> Set special hours for holidays in advance</li>
                        <li><strong>Promotions:</strong> Add happy hour specials, prix fixe menus, wine dinners, special events</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>For daily specials, many restaurants text the AI each morning: "Daily specials: Pan-seared halibut $32, Wild mushroom risotto $24, Strawberry shortcake $12" and the AI incorporates this into conversations within 15 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This ensures guests always hear current, accurate information without needing to train or brief staff every day.</p>
