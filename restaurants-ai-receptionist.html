                <h2>The Hidden Cost of Missed Calls in Restaurants & Hospitality</h2>

                    <h3>Lost Reservations During Peak Hours</h3>
                    <p>Friday at 6:45pm: your host is seating the 6:30 reservations who arrived late. The phone rings - a couple wanting a table tonight at 8pm. It rings 6 times before going to voicemail. They hang up and call the restaurant across the street that answers immediately. You just lost a $220 check (2 entrees, apps, drinks, dessert) without ever knowing they called.</p>
                    <p class="problem-stat"><strong>Real impact:</strong> A fine dining restaurant in Portland tracked missed calls for 30 days. During peak hours (5:30-8:30pm Thursday-Saturday), 47% of calls went unanswered. Of those, an estimated 65% were reservation requests. At an average $185 per table and 2.3 guests per reservation, they lost an estimated $43,872 in monthly revenue ($526,464 annually) from reservations that went to competitors.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>The Takeout Order Problem</h3>
                    <p>Your busy pizza restaurant receives 40-50 takeout calls during dinner hours. Your staff is taking orders, making pizzas, and managing the oven. When calls go unanswered, customers order from delivery apps (where you pay 20-30% commissions) or call competitors. Each missed takeout call costs $45-$85 in immediate revenue.</p>
                    <p class="problem-stat"><strong>Real impact:</strong> A casual Italian restaurant implemented call tracking and discovered they missed 278 calls in a single month, with 89% occurring during their busiest dinner hours. Follow-up surveys revealed 67% were trying to place takeout orders averaging $72. This represented $13,414 in lost monthly revenue ($160,968 annually). After implementing AI call handling, they captured an additional $9,350 monthly in takeout orders that previously went unanswered.</p>
                </div>

                    <div class="problem-icon">🎉</div>
                    <h3>Catering Revenue Left on the Table</h3>
                    <p>Catering orders average $800-$3,500 and require minimal additional labor compared to regular service. But when busy restaurants miss catering inquiry calls (typically during daytime hours when restaurants have smaller staff), they lose high-margin opportunities that could fill slow days and supplement revenue.</p>
                    <p class="problem-stat"><strong>Real impact:</strong> A restaurant with strong catering capabilities tracked calls and discovered they missed 23 catering inquiries in 3 months - averaging 7.6 missed calls per month. Conservative estimate: if 40% would have converted at an average $1,450 per order, the restaurant lost $40,020 annually in catering revenue. After implementing AI with automatic high-value lead notification, they converted 18 catering orders in the following 3 months worth $27,300.</p>
