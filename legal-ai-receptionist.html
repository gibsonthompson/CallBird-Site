                <h2>The Real Cost of Missed Calls for Law Firms</h2>
            </div>

                    <div class="problem-icon">⚖️</div>
                    <h3>Lost High-Value Cases</h3>
                    <p>A single personal injury case averages $15,000-50,000 in attorney fees. If your firm misses just 2 PI consultation calls per week because you're in depositions or court, that's $240,000-$800,000 in annual lost revenue. Family law cases average $8,000-15,000. Estate planning $2,500-5,000. One missed call can equal months of salary.</p>
                    <p class="problem-stat"><strong>Reality check:</strong> Prospective clients call 3-4 firms before choosing one. If you don't answer, they hire your competitor. It's that simple.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="problem-card">
                    <div class="problem-icon">⏰</div>
                    <h3>After-Hours Opportunity Loss</h3>
                    <p>42% of legal calls come outside 9-5 business hours. People call lawyers when they're stressed - late at night after an arrest, on weekends after receiving divorce papers, early morning before work. If your voicemail says "call back Monday," they're calling the 24/7 law firm down the street.</p>
                    <p class="problem-stat"><strong>Real impact:</strong> Law firms using 24/7 AI receptionists report 3-5 additional case signings monthly from after-hours calls alone. Average case value: $12,000-$45,000 depending on practice area.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="problem-card">
                    <div class="problem-icon">🚫</div>
                    <h3>Time Wasted on Unqualified Leads</h3>
                    <p>60% of law firm calls are unqualified: wrong practice area, jurisdiction conflicts, statute of limitations expired, no damages, sales calls. If your firm gets 40 calls/day and spends 5 minutes on each unqualified caller, that's 200 minutes daily (67 hours monthly) wasted on calls that can't convert to cases. At $300/hour attorney rates, that's $20,000 in wasted time.</p>
                    <p class="problem-stat"><strong>Solution:</strong> AI screens calls systematically with qualifying questions. Only forwards cases in your practice areas, within statute of limitations, in proper jurisdiction, and meeting your minimum case value.</p>

                    <p>The AI conducts thorough intake for new client calls: contact information, case type and description, urgency level, geographic location for jurisdiction check, prior legal representation, conflicts check, and practice-specific questions (accident date for PI, charges for criminal defense, marriage date for family law, estate size for estate planning).</p>
                    <p class="feature-highlight"><strong>Result:</strong> Complete intake data flows directly to your case management system (Clio, MyCase, PracticePanther)</p>

Qualified leads are immediately scheduled for consultation or transferred to available attorney. Unqualified leads are politely declined with referrals when appropriate.</p>
                    <p class="feature-highlight"><strong>Result:</strong> You only talk to qualified prospects, saving hours weekly on unqualified calls</p>

                    <p>The AI recognizes emergency situations and escalates appropriately: arrests or booking, court appearances within 48 hours, protective orders served, imminent statute of limitations deadlines, and child custody emergencies trigger immediate attorney notification. Urgent but non-emergency matters get priority consultation scheduling.</p>

                    <p>"Before CallBird, I was losing 4-6 potential PI cases monthly to missed calls - I'm in court, depositions, or with clients most of the day. That was $200K+ in annual lost revenue. CallBird's AI now handles all intake calls 24/7. It asks the right questions, filters out unqualified leads, and schedules qualified prospects directly in my Clio calendar. In 4 months, I've signed 11 additional cases I would have never connected with. ROI is literally 100x."</p>
