                    <h3>Lost Sales While Helping In-Store Customers</h3>
                    <p>A customer calls asking "Do you have the blue running shoes in size 9?" Your staff is helping someone try on clothes, ringing up purchases, and restocking shelves. The call rings 6 times, goes to voicemail. The customer calls the store down the street who answers immediately. You just lost a $120 sale without knowing they called.</p>
                    <p class="problem-stat"><strong>Real impact:</strong> A sporting goods store tracked missed calls for 60 days. They averaged 23 missed calls per week during business hours. Follow-up revealed 71% were product availability questions with purchase intent. At an average $85 transaction value, they were losing $1,660 weekly ($86,320 annually) to missed calls. After implementing AI, they captured $6,200 in additional monthly sales from previously missed calls.</p>

                    <h3>After-Hours Shoppers Can't Reach You</h3>
                    <p>It's 7 PM. Your store closed at 6 PM. A customer calls wanting to know if you have a specific item in stock before driving 20 minutes tomorrow. Voicemail. They check online retailers instead and order for next-day delivery. You lose the sale before your store even opens.</p>
                    <p class="problem-stat"><strong>Real impact:</strong> A boutique clothing store implemented after-hours AI call handling. In the first 3 months, they received 340 after-hours calls (averaging 3.8 per day). The AI answered product questions, confirmed inventory, and told customers when to visit. Result: 47% of those callers came in-store the next day, generating $18,400 in sales that previously went to online competitors.</p>

                    <p>Black Friday weekend, Small Business Saturday, Christmas shopping season - your store is packed with customers, phones ringing constantly, and you're short-staffed. Every call that goes unanswered during holiday rush is lost revenue you'll never recover.</p>
                    <p class="problem-stat"><strong>Real impact:</strong> A gift shop tracked calls during November-December holiday season. They missed 180 calls during their busiest 6 weeks (average 4.3 per day). Post-season surveys revealed 65% were trying to check gift item availability or holiday hours. With average holiday purchase of $75, they lost an estimated $8,775 in holiday sales - their most profitable season - to unanswered calls. The next year with AI, they captured those calls and had their best season ever.</p>
